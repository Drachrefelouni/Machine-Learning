	* DENsity-based CLUstEring (DENCLUE)
	* Fuzzy C-Means (FCM)
	* Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
	* Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN)
	* Mean Shift Clustering (MSC)
	* Optics (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure)
	* Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)
